# Analysis of NYC Citi Bike Share System
The aim of this project is to analyze New York City's [Citi Bike Share system](https://citibikenyc.com/), which is something that is heavily rooted in the city's culture. The analysis will follow the CRISP-DM process, or the _Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining_ framework.

## Questions of Interests
Which stations have longer trip times on average?

When are bikers most actively riding bikes?

Which stations have the receive bikes from the most stations? Which stations send bikes to the most stations?

Can we identify any monotonic relationships for future modeling?
