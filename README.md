# Analysis of NYC Citi Bike Share System

The aim of this project is to analyze New York City's [Citi Bike Share system](https://citibikenyc.com/), a staple in the city's culture. The analysis will follow the CRISP-DM process, or the _Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining_ framework.

This README.md file provides an overview of each section. The technical analysis and code will be in `analysis.ipynb`, and a casual presentation will be provided in this [Medium article]().

## Questions of Interest

- Which stations have longer trip times on average?
- When are bikers most actively riding bikes?
- Which stations receive bikes from the most stations? Which stations send bikes to the most stations?
- Can we identify any monotonic relationships for future modeling?
